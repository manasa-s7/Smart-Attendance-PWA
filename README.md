Smart Attendance PWA is a Progressive Web Application that provides a modern, offline-capable, and location-aware attendance system without the need for a backend server. It leverages QR code scanning, geolocation, peer-to-peer technology, and localStorage to mark and track user attendance efficiently — even in low or no internet connectivity.
The app is designed especially for educational institutions, workshops, or events where tracking attendance digitally in real-time with minimal setup is needed.
